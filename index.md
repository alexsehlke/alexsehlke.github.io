Hello, my name is **Alex Sehlke**, I am a Geologist at NASA Ames Research Center with the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute (BAERI).

My work focuses on science and exploration of our Moon. I focus on **Thermoluminescence** studies of lunar regolith samples to determine the temperature and radiation history of the lunar surface and subsurface. I am working on **space-flight instrument** development for robotic and human space exploration. Moreover, **volcanism** and the rheology of terrestrial and planetary lava analogs, as well as lava flow morphologies and surfaces are are also part of my research interest.
