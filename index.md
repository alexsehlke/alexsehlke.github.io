**Dr. Alexander Sehlke** ([curriculum vitae](static/sehlke-cv-feb-2020.pdf)) is a planetary geologist in the [Space Sciences & Astrobiology Division, Planetary Systems Branch](https://spacescience.arc.nasa.gov/branch/planetary-systems-branch-code-sst/) of NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) in California.

I integrate field observations with labortaory exoperimennts to study magma ascent, volcanic eruptions and lava emplacement on Earth and other rocky bodies in the solar system, with particular focus on the Moon and Mars.

I study the physical and tehrmal properties of terrestrial lava, planetary analog magma/lava, lunar samples, and meteorites.

I am very intersted to work with students in the field and/or helping with laboratory experiments. Please [email me](mailto:alexander.sehlke@nasa.gov) for opportunities.
