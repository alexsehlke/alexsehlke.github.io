Hello, my name is **Alex Sehlke**, I am a Geologist at NASA Ames Research Center with the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute (BAERI).

My work focuses on science and exploration of our Moon. I focus on Thermoluminescence studies of lunar regolith samples to determine the temperature and radiation history of the lunar surface and subsurface. Moreover, I am working on space-flight instrument development.
