## <u>Thermoluminescence Studies of Lunar Samples</u>

I study the thermoluminescene (TL) properties of lunar and lunar analog samples, which is useful to determine the temperature and radiation history of these samples. With the increasing interest in propsecting for volatiles on planetary surfaces, I am interested in applying the results to reconstruc the thermal history of the lunar surface.



Moreover, I am also pursuing to develip a small-scale, leightweight TL instrument that would provide in-situ TL measurements on the Moon. The instrument prototype is named THEIA, which stands for Thermal History Exploration Instrument for Artemis. It is nam,ed after the greek deity Theia who gives glimmer and shining to materials.
