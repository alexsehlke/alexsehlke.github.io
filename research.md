I am have several active research grants supporting the following studies:

* **Magma/Lava Rheology and Flow Laws:** I operate a rheometer to measure the viscosity of silicate melts (liquids and crystal suspensions) between 1 to 10<sup>6</sup> Pa s, and up to 1700 ÂºC. The theometer is attached to a CO/CO<sub>2</sub> gas mixing unit to conduct experiments at desired oxygen fugacities, which makes it possible to investigate the rheological evolution during cooling and crystallization for iron-bearing magmas/lavas, such as lunar and martian basalts. It is possible to in-situ sample the magma/lava by a rapid quenching technique for further investigation (e.g., crystallinity, crystal assemblages and textures, mixing textures).

* **Thermoluminescence Studies of Lunar Samples and Meteotites:**

* **Spectral and Geochmical Signatures of Spatter Deposits interacting with Water and Ice:**
