## Thermoluminescence Studies of Lunar Samples

I study the thermoluminescene (TL) properties of lunar and lunar analog samples, which are useful to determine the temperature and radiation history of these samples. With the increasing interest in propsecting for volatiles on planetary surfaces, I am interested in applying the results to reconstruc the thermal history of the lunar surface.
